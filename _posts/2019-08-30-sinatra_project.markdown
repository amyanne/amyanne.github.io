Learning how to use sinatra was surprisingly straight forward. The biggest issue I ran into was setting up my sign up and login page. Those were some of the first routes I set up. I had to play around to get it to and then once I got it going to the correct pages I had to figure out why my signup page wasn't saving. There was a lot of experimenting. I did debugging code of putting put "counter" to see what code was even getting hit and from there I was able to get my sign up working. 

This project was a lot of fun to do. It was interesting to learn what goes into some many applications we use every day. I created a very simple climbing tracker. I allow user to create an account to track the name, grade, and location of their climb. It was very simple, but still a challenge to create!
