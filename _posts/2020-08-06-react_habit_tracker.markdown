For my final project I build a habit tracker. 

For this project my I needed to models in my ruby backend to persist data. My frontend I had to create a form to create habits. Next I created a show page for the habits. The next part of the project was more interesting. To build the calendar I had to research how to use Moment. By using moment I was able to set up a calendar that starts the week 3 days for the current date. Next I had to build a matrix. I next built a check box class that I imported into my matrix. After that I had to build the fetch and add features for the dates. Overall I learned a lot from this project.
