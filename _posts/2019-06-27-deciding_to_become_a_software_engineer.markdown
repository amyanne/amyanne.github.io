Approaching my mid-twenties, my life was directionless. I had been nannying for 6+ years, knowing that wouldn't lead anywhere. I found myself desiring more out of a job. I started exploring the qualities I wanted in a career, trying to figure out what would lead to fulfillment. I started meeting with people from many different fields and directions. I started setting up these meetings and would interview people about their lives. I would ask them the following questions:

1. What did it take to currently get to where you currently are in your job?

2. What do you like and dislike about your line of work?

3. What does a typical day in your life look like?

4. What does your recreational time look like?

5. What do you think it the most important thing to know about going into a career like this?

There were many futures that looked like they could be promising, but there was always something that left me feeling unsure. Then I started talking to software engineers. They were consistently the most excited about their line of work. They talked about the mental reward of spending their day solving hard problems, the job security and flexibility, and the lifestyle it allowed. The biggest issue most of them seemed to have with it was anxiety that comes with not always feeling smart enough for the field. 

After meeting with multiple software engineers, I spent a lot of time thinking about what they said. Problem solving has always been something I've enjoyed and if the biggest complaint they have is imposter syndrome, I felt that was an obstacle I could most definitely overcome.
